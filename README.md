# Business Impact analyst on XYZ Ltd
## Overview and Origin
This company is called XYZ Ltd. 
XYZ Ltd was originally named as Super XYZ Pty Ltd, which was founded in 2005. The original software is called XYZ Super. The idea to create the XYZ Super product emerged form the needs of SmartSuper, a Sydney based SMSF administrator. Smartsuper’s CEO, Andrew Bloore, was looking for an administration solution to achieve efficiencies and scale beyond the 1,000 or so funds that Smartsuper administered at the time. 
## Business Activities
One specific financial problems of XYZ is how to steadily increase its share price.
In 2017, the government has published Super Reform 2017. The purpose of the Super Reform is for the government to obtain a clearer oversight of the super fund industry and to monitoring individual persons total superannuation balance for future planning of the superannuation and pension purpose. Along with this Super Reform, an extra 15% of tax has been applied to earnings on a particular type of pension account. This type of pension account has been proved to be a popular tool among financial planners and tax accountants for the purpose to boost up cash flow while saving up tax. After the announcement of this particular rule, there is a significant impact on people who were planning to set up their SMSF, which now have decided to seek options other than SMSF. 
Given that the intended and existing customers of XYZ Super are tax accountants and financial planners who administrates SMSF of their clients. The above impact has been proved to be quite harsh on XYZ super product. If there is less demand, then there is less sales. Then it will impact the share price significantly. 
 XYZ has an enviable 40-50% share of the $100 million SMSF administration market, which had been fast growing until the government imposed a $1.6 million cap on super accounts. 
In situation as such, there are couple of strategies XYZ has since undertaken:
1.	XYZ Ltd decided to publish a new product. This product is called XYZ Trust. The product provides resolution for Family Trust Administration. Given the Super Reform has ceased people’s interest in setting up SMSF, they have put more focus on Family Trust structure. 
2.	XYZ Ltd has hence purchased several existing companies. These companies provide compliance and legislation documents for SMSF, Trust and Companies structures. As these documents are essential different tax structures, XYZ will gain more revenue from providing these services to existing clients and intended clients. Given the limitation size of these documentation service in the industry, the competitors 
XYZ Super is using an Agile methodology in building up features. They don’t customise their service for specific clients, but rather setting up different configurations for clients to choose. 
## Landscape
XYZ is in the Wealth management industry. It is a resolution for accountants in public practice. The most important feature clients are requesting from this type of accounting software is to be efficient and help decreasing the time spent on processing and generating reports. 
Currently, most of the accounting software have the ability to obtain data from third party financial institutions and automatically create the other side of the journal entries based on double journal rule. This has been proved to save up clients’ processing time. What else to do for helping clients to maintain their productivity. One of the other time consuming tasks is to enter invoices and etc. To help clients, one of the solution provided is to develop the skill of Optical Character Recognition. This allows client to upload a scanned documents into the application, then from OCR tool built in the application, information will be extracted from the document and populated them into the fields designated for these information.
Among the accounting resolution providers, the other big companies in this area are Xero, MYOB and BGL Pty Ltd (another SMSF resolution provider).
## Result
The main business impact on XYZ Ltd is the regulation from the governing bodies of different tax structures. For example, the 2017 Super Reform has reduced the enthusiastic on setting up new SMSF. 
Other business impact is the investment options and financial market. If the financial market is not performing well, then people tend to keep their money in hand rather than putting them into super or other tax structure for investing purpose. 
Among this industry, one of the core metrics to measure success is the market share. This means for accounting software to drive more revenue, they need to win more clients and to gain big clients. XYZ40% of the market share is quite successful in this area. 

## Recommendations
I believe XYZ Ltd could offer the portfolio management to their clients. This recommendation is based on below observations:
1.	existing data from different financial institution. 
2.	End clients have access to their portfolio online (XYZas built the resolution to allow members logging into the application to view their own portfolios)
3.	This will potentially attracts more clients which are seeking to have a consolidated application which provides all the relevant services
This will attract more clients to join, which potentially will also increase the market shares of the existing application. This new portfolio management application will attract financial advisers. As the 2012 ASIC updates, only financial advisers who have certain qualifications are allowed to provide advice to individual on establishing SMSF. Financial advisers are seeking the end to end service provider to establish the fund, admin the fund and manage the portfolio of the fund using XYZ. As XYZ already has the admin system and the fund establish documentation system. 
It requires API to pull data from other financial institute and field into the already built application.
